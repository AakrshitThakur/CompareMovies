# CompareMovies
In this project, CompareMovies, you can search for all the movies available in the tvmaze.com database. I have used the TVmaze free API to get all the data that I need using Axios for fetching purposes. The CompareMovies project is made purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to compare any two movies at a time.
